# Console Application Examples for .Net Core #

A collection of .NET Core applications demonstrating various .NET Core features 
(as another has said, Console Applications seem not to have the Love of ASP.NET ones!)
Where it's possible, it's easier to trial a new feature in a Console App as the develop/build/test cycle is so much more convenient.

1. Basic startup of a Console App, with Environment support similar to an ASP.NET startup.
